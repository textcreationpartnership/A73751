            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My purpoſe and proceedings heerein haue not reached in any abſolute manner to decide all the poynts of this our Controuerſie; and by all Authenticall Authors, and ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitiue church, or moderne Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to diſcuſſe this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (which many others

               <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> God is the Father of Chriſt (as God) by Generation, being Father by nature vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, begetting him of his owne Subſtance, before all time. And heere let vs a little conſider the wonderfulneſſe of this generation, manifeſted in three reſpects, wherein this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration differs from all others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In all other generations the Father is firſt in being, and before the Sonne: but in this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173209:36"/> generation there is an equalitie of time; for we haue an eternal Sonne of an eternall Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> If any ſhall obiect that ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee;</hi> which may ſeeme to imply a begetting of the Son in Time. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this day implies the certainety of generation, not the time when he was begotten, which was from eternitie, though manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the world in time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this heauenly generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Father doth communicate his whole nature, and Eſſence, vnto the Sonne, and yet retaines the whole nature and Eſſence in himſelfe (which is a myſtery ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange and admirable) and differing from all other genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for in all earthly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, nature is diuided; part being communicated to the ſonne, and part retained ſtill in the Father.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:173209:37"/>
            <p>Thirdly, An earthly father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a locall body, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, begets a ſonne <hi>extra ſe,</hi> foorth of himſelfe: but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God being euery where, and filling euery place, begets a Sonne <hi>intra ſe,</hi> within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not without, becauſe there is no place without him.

            <p>Secondly, others interpret the Keyes to bee nothing elſe, but <hi>Munus docendi Euangelium,</hi> the Office of teaching the Goſpell, wherunto for our owne part we ſo conſent, that we thinke it yet falleth ſhort of the full ſcope thereby intended, for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Diſcipline, as well as Doctrine in the Church of God: which matter, becauſe it would require a more ample and exact diſcourſe, than is perhaps fitting for this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> time, and Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I will paſſe by alſo, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them that are deſirous of further reſolution in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to that which is purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written of diuers concerning

            <p>The Metaphor of Keyes, is borrowed from that Inſtrument which we commonly vſe in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or ſafe locking vp of things appropriated to our owne priuate vſe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and ſo the ſenſe of the Keyes is diuerſly taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Keyes are taken for matters of truſt and authoritie committed to ſome more worthy perſon of truſt, as a Steward to diſpoſe of whatſoeuer is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in an houſehold: And ſo <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had the Keyes of <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 39. 4</note>

            <p>There was a time when the Apoſtles might not preach Chriſt to the <note n="x" place="margin">Math. 10. 5, 6.</note> Gentiles, nor Samaritanes, till the Iewes firſt had reiected him: And it was for a time that the Holy Ghoſt was not giuen in viſible ſignes vnto the Apoſtles; <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 13. 45, 46</note> for <hi>that Ieſus was not yet glorified:</hi> after whoſe Aſcenſion hee was to bee ſent downe, that they might know, that it was <note n="z" place="margin">Iohn 16. 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> his gift as well as his Fathers, <note n="a" place="margin">Ephe. 4. 7, 8.</note> for the building vp of his Church: <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 68. 18.</note> And if hee had not gone away, that Comforter could not haue come vnto them. And in many other places of the Scriptures, hee referreth them to the time of his Paſsion finiſhed, and ſayeth, <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 15. 27, 28. &amp; 14. 26. &amp; 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>That if hee were once lifted vp, hee would then draw all men vnto him:</hi> and till then hee laboured eſpecially to bring home the loſt Sheepe of the houſe of Iſrael: and after his paſsion they ſhould all knowe,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:173209:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> that hee was the Chriſt. And when his Mother would vrge him to a Myracle at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galile,</hi> before hee had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Goſpell, hee gaue her a reaſon to ſtay the time; <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>For that his houre was not yet come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it appeareth, that the mightie workes of Chriſt were lawfully, and laudably publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by thoſe which receyued them: and the lunatike perſon, out of whom were caſt a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deuils, which entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heard of Swine, was by Chriſt himſelfe required <note n="e" place="margin">Mark. 5. 19, 20.</note> to go home to his friends, and to make knowne vnto them what great things the Lord had done for him. By this and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it is apparantly euident, that it was neuer the purpoſe of our Sauiour, to haue eyther himſelfe or his workes concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alwayes. And true it is, that Chriſt doeth not heere ſimply
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:173209:121"/> charge his Diſciples, not to publiſh him, but onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale him for a time, till hee had fully finiſhed the worke of mans Redemption vpon the Croſſe: and then after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection hee ſendes them into all the world with a Commiſſion <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 28, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>to preach him to all Nations:</hi> This being the trueſt anſwere, (as I conceiue) for concluſion, giues vs this briefe but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Inſtruction, namely, <label type="milestone">

               <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) a time to ſpeake, and a time to holde our peace:</hi> And <hi>Samuel</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:173209:122"/> was contented to bee aduiſed by God, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 2.</note> in doing his meſſage vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the ſafegard of his life.

               <hi>Abigail</hi> was wiſe to ſtay the reproofe of <hi>Nabals</hi> Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and other his miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges towards the Meſſengers of <hi>Dauid,</hi> till the wine was out of his head; and then ſhewing vnto him what danger his folly had caſt him into, ſhe ſtroke him as dead as a ſtone.</p>
            <p>Thus as <note n="k" place="margin">Leuit. 2. 13.</note> all Sacrifices muſt bee ſeaſoned with ſalt, ſo muſt all <note n="l" place="margin">Coloſſ. 4. 6.</note> our ſpeeches and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings bee ſeaſoned with the ſalt of wiſedome and godly diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo they may bee ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and ſauoury to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
